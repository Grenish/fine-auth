## Introduction

**Fine Auth** is designed to be the "just right" solution for developers who need robust authentication without the complexity of massive frameworks. It provides a simple, secure, and flexible foundation that you can drop into any project.

It's not trying to replace everything. It's just... fine.

## Features

- **Framework Agnostic**: Works with Express, Hono, Fastify, Next.js, or raw Node.js/Bun.
- **Database Agnostic**: Bring your own database. We support PostgreSQL, and soon MongoDB, Prisma, and more.
- **Secure by Default**: Argon2id/Scrypt hashing, signed session tokens, and safe defaults.
- **TypeScript**: Built with TypeScript for excellent type safety and autocomplete.
- **Lightweight**: Zero large dependencies. Keep your bundle size small.

## Philosophy

Modern authentication libraries often force you into a specific way of doing things. **Fine Auth** takes a different approach:

1.  **Simplicity**: The API should be intuitive and minimal.
2.  **Control**: You own your database connection and client.
3.  **Transparency**: No black magic. Understand exactly what's happening under the hood.
